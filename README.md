# Oblate Spheriod

### Intro

I came into coding from the traditional research world (environmental science). I started building models in R and Python, and later moved into scientific computing using Python and now dabbling with Julia. I'm now focused mostly on machine learning, text mining/natural language processing, and visualizations/front-end development in on-demand and deployed applications.
